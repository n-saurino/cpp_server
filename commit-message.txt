chore(network): Review NetworkHandler for C++ best practices compliance

Performed a review of the NetworkHandler implementation to ensure adherence to C++ best practices, focusing on code quality, maintainability, and correctness. This is part of an ongoing effort to refine the network component for optimal performance.

Changes:
- Reviewed NetworkHandler code for compliance with C++ best practices.
- Identified potential areas for improvement in structure and design.

Next steps:
- Implement a performance logging system to track optimization improvements.
- Migrate from char buffers to FIX SBE for a performance comparison.
- Research and apply socket programming optimization techniques.
- Refactor legacy code to align with C++ best practices and style guidelines.
