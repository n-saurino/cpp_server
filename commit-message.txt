feat(codec): Integrate FIX SBE for message encoding/decoding

Explored the FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) protocol and integrated Aeron-IO's SBE tool for generating a codec based on a FIX message schema. This establishes a foundation for efficient, low-latency message encoding and decoding in the FIX engine.

Changes:
- Studied the FIX SBE specification and its implications for message serialization.
- Selected Aeron-IO's SBE tool for codec generation to streamline encoding/decoding.
- Designed an initial FIX SBE message schema for testing and validation.
- Prepared the framework for future schema extensions and optimizations.

Next steps:
- Investigate additional message parsing and construction requirements.
- Develop the Network Handler to optimize message transmission and handling.
