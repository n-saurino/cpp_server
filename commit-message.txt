refactor(core): Perform initial C++ best practices cleanup

Completed a first-pass cleanup of project files to improve adherence to C++ best practices. Added empty FIXMessageBuilder class to implement as our next feature. Additionally, identified the need to implement exception handling in the socket programming module.

Changes:
- Performed initial cleanup and refactored code for C++ best practices compliance.
- Added empty `FIXMessageBuilder` to support upcoming FIX SBE message transmission.
- Identified missing exception handling in socket programming (to be addressed).

Next steps:
- Implement basic FIX SBE message transmission between the Engine and test server within the next 24 hours.
- Continue refining exception handling in the socket programming module.
- Implement a performance logging system to track optimization improvements.
- Further optimize message handling for performance and reliability.
