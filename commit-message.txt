perf(benchmark): Implement Network Profiler for RTT measurements

Created a benchmarking framework within the Network Profiler to measure round-trip time (RTT), latency, and throughput of client transmissions. This establishes baseline performance metrics for future optimizations of the FIX engine.

Changes:
- Implemented initial benchmarking framework focused on RTT measurements
- Developed dedicated tests for latency and throughput evaluation
- Created new NetworkProfiler class to encapsulate benchmarking functionality

Next steps:
- Implement performance logging system to track optimization improvements
- Migrate from char buffers to FIX SBE for performance comparison
- Research and apply socket programming optimization techniques
