fix(network): Improve socket error handling and buffer safety

Updated socket programming error handling for base functionality, with plans to revisit and refine it further this weekend. Adjusted the Network Profiler benchmark test functions to be static for better compliance with C++ best practices. Additionally, added null termination to the `in_buffer` to prevent buffer overflow risks.

Changes:
- Enhanced socket error handling logic (to be revisited this weekend).
- Made Network Profiler benchmark test functions static for C++ best practices compliance.
- Added null termination to `in_buffer` to mitigate potential buffer overflows.

Next steps:
- Implement basic FIX SBE message transmission between the Engine and test server within the next 24 hours.
- Continue refining exception handling in the socket programming module.
- Implement a performance logging system to track optimization improvements.
- Further optimize message handling for performance and reliability.
